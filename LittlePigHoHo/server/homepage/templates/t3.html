<h1>
    Example Cafe Recipes- Worlds Best Scrambled eggs
</h1>
<!--<h4>-->
    <p>
        i adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my lst visit to bills
        restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the
        best scrambled eggs i have ever tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe is what I call a very special breakfast; just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.
